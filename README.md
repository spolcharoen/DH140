DH140 Website by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

## About Me
Hello! My name is Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen and I am currently a second-year UCLA Statistics major and Digital Humanities minor. Originally, I am from Bangkok, Thailand, but I am stationed in Westwood for now. Through data science, I hope to explore various topics, such as UX design research, social justice work, and advertising/marketing in the entertainment industry. Outside of school, I enjoy singing, cooking and baking, and traveling!

## About the Course
DH140 is an introductory course to coding and data science, with focus on Python. Throughout the quarter, we will learn how to use digital information to further explore humanistic ideas and questions.

From the [course site](https://github.com/yohman/21W-DH140):
> The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of coding and data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in the humanities? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, data analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced spatial analysis will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize digital data for humanistic practices and research.

## Project Ideas and Objectives for the Course
My research interests include music, advertising and marketing, UX design, and social justice. Through this course, I hope to delve into one of these topics with some of my classmates. Some specific project ideas I have are:
* Explore what variables are affecting popular music trends.
* Explore how social media marketing is changing companies' ad campaigns.
* Explore the extend of the affect of the Coronavirus pandemic on the music industry, in regard to sales and shifting to an online format.

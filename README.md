# Digital Humanities 140: Coding for Humanities
DH140 Website by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

## About Me
Hi! My name is Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen and I am currently a second-year UCLA Statistics major and Digital Humanities minor. Originally, I am from Bangkok, Thailand, but I am stationed in Westwood for now. Through data science, I hope to explore various topics, such as UX design research, social justice work, and advertising/marketing in the entertainment industry. Outside of school, I enjoy singing, cooking and baking, and traveling!

## About the Course
> The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of coding and data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in the humanities? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, data analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced spatial analysis will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize digital data for humanistic practices and research.

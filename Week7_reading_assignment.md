# DH140: Week 7 Reading Assignment
by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

For this assignment, I read the chapter "Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media" and the Egypt section from the book, _HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities_.

## Reflection
After reading the chapter, I found the conversations around the interconnectedness of events and the ethical implications of social media and data very interesting. It was very exciting to see how a tweet, a moment in time, can build and become such a huge project such as HyperCities. The network graphs in the Egypt section are a great demonstration of how events can be linked. Seeing the lines connecting between the various hashtags and then, between the Libya and Egypt events, was fascinating. Although each individual events and communities become difficult to see in the large graphs, knowing that they are an integral part of the whole is a broad view that I had never seen accurately visualized before. Furthermore, with the vast dispensary of data online and on social media, it is interesting to think about how what I do online is being analyzed and connected to various events. This is where the topic of ethics and bias comes in. Before it was mentioned in the chapter, I had not really thought about the ethical implications of studying events that don't necessarily affect me. At what point does looking and analyzing this data become exploitive rather than helpful? With data so out in the open, all it takes is one person with bad intentions to manipulate others. I think this is a conversation that should be more widely discussed in the future, especially since social media and digital media is becoming so integral to all our lives.

## Questions for the Authors
1. How do you navitage the ethics of spatial and disaster data analysis?
2. How can Twitter and/or other social media sites in the future make analysis easier and catered towards data scientists?

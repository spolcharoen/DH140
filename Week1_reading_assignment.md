# DH140 Week 1 Reading Assignment
by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

The article I chose is from The Guardian, titled "[Recession in real time: how big data can track the Covid slump](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/08/recession-in-real-time-big-data-covid-slump-economy-unconventional-indicators)" by Richard Partington. Partington covers how the shock of Covid has changed the availability of data, and how people have been turning to unconventional indicators to further explore the current conditions of the world, specifically in regards to recessions and economic slumps. In the article, the author provides various visualizations to showcase the unusual data being examined. Some examples are internet searches, road traffic, pollution data, and more. These data sets are from the current Coronavirus pandemic, and are meant to display indicators of the current economy. With each set, Partington briefly analyzes how dips and increases in certain factors are potential indicators of the state of the world. Overall, he presents a compelling argument for looking at atypical data during a data recession.

As a statistics major, this article was really interesting to me in regards to the different ways data can reflect the real world and show correlation between seemingly unrelated variables. The pandemic has changed how everyone functions day-to-day, and with that comes new and exciting data. The article stuck out to me because it essentially explained how data will always tell a story, even seemingly mundane data sets, such as car usage and restaurant bookings. After reading the article, the article shifted my data science goals towards looking further into the pandemic and how it has affected my topics of interest. For instance, in regard to my interest in music, I am now more inclined to explore unusual indicators within streaming and song popularity. Furthermore, I would like to look into how shifting online has impacted the entertainment industry. Ultimately, the article gave me a new perspective in which to view data and how it represents current events.

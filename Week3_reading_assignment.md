### Reflection
Shortly after viewing the video, I am very impressed and captivated by how so many people have come together from across the world to work on the Missing Maps program, as well as help with the Red Cross and their work. I feel that data is one of the most powerful tools in the world, and to be using it for such a great cause is really amazing to see. It was very interesting to see the whole process that goes into making maps and cultivating data. 

In the past, I feel as though data is usually grouped with the tech industry and STEM, but it is clearly useful and very impactful in the humanities and humanitarian causes as well. As long as there is something to document, there is data to be found and analyzed. No matter the cause, I think that open data can be utilized to advance us. Especially with the pandemic, I feel that now more than ever, there is time to explore open data at home to make the world a better place.
